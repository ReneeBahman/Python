# 🐍 Python for Data Analysis – Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Data Analysis repo! This repository documents my learning journey in Python, with a focus on acquiring the skills necessary for effective data manipulation, analysis, and future experimentation with machine learning and AI.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming basics
- Become proficient with data analysis libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Practice real-world data wrangling and visualization
- Apply statistical methods learned during my Economic Analysis Master's program
- Explore predictive modeling and AI-based projects in the future

---

## ✅ Current Focus: Python Fundamentals

### Completed Topics
- [x] Variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- [x] Collections (`list`, `dict`, `set`, `tuple`)
- [x] Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- [x] Basic string manipulation and escape characters
- [x] File input/output
- [x] GitHub integration using VS Code

### Next Up
- [ ] Functions and modular code
- [ ] Loops and list comprehensions
- [ ] Error handling and working with files
- [ ] Starting with `pandas` and `numpy`
- [ ] Visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🧩 Python to Pandas Bridge (Mini Cheat Sheet)

| Python Concept        | Pandas Equivalent           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `list`                | `Series`                    |
| `dict`                | `Series` or `DataFrame`     |
| List of dicts         | `DataFrame`                 |
| `sum(my_list)`        | `df['column'].sum()`        |
| Filtering with `if`   | `df[df['column'] > value]`  |
| `for` loop over list  | `df.apply()` or vector ops  |
